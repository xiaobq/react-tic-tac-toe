This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Then I changed this project by following the Facebook Tutorial (https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

It created the Tic-tac-toe game.
After that, I have done the following enhancements to this project after completing the tutorial:
1. Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
2. Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
5. Show a "Restart" button to restart the game.
